GitHub Actions to automatically update labels based on the D-n rule

## D-n rule

It's a way to indicate the code review deadline on a PR using a D-n format label, helping reviewers prioritize and work more efficiently.

- If a review needs to be completed within 3 days, add a `D-3` label to the PR.
- For urgent updates, use the `D-0` label to signal that an immediate review is needed.

`D-n` labels need to be updated daily. `d-day-labeler` automates that process.

## Usage

1. Create a `.github/workflows/d-day-labeler.yml` file:

```yml
name: Update D-n Labels
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 15 * * *' # Runs daily at midnight (KST)
jobs:
  d-day-labeler:
    runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]
    steps:
      - name: Update D-n Labels
        uses: naver/d-day-labeler@latest
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          skipDraft: true # Set to true to skip draft PRs (optional)
```

2. Add a `D-n` label (e.g., `D-5`, `D-3`) to a PR.
3. `d-day-labeler` will automatically update the label daily.

## Inputs

### `token`

**Required** GitHub token

### `skipDraft`

**Optional** Determines whether to skip draft PRs when updating labels. Default: `false`
